\* Fixing some of the Hover Colors for links on the Hero section of the Front page of the Beacon Theme */


unformatted notes to fix later: 

a.jp-relatedposts-post-a  links on 3 related posts at the bottom of the pages; don't seem to match overall colors

a.dark = link on front page that is orange on hover
